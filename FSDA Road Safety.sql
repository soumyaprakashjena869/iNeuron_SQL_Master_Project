Business problem:

The UK Department of Transport provides open datasets on road safety and casualties, and one can
use these datasets to analyze how safe the roads in the UK are. This project will help you answer a
few questions using their 2015 dataset.

The dataset has 3 tables i.e Accident, vehicle, Vehicle_type

Approach/Project Idea
Use aggregate functions in SQL and Python to answer the following sample questions:
1. Evaluate the median severity value of accidents caused by various Motorcycles.
2. Evaluate Accident Severity and Total Accidents per Vehicle Type
3. Calculate the Average Severity by vehicle type.
4. Calculate the Average Severity and Total Accidents by Motorcycle.

                           ANSWER
       
SELECT * FROM accidents_2015;
SELECT * FROM Vehicles_2015;
SELECT * FROM vehicle_types;

-- ANALYZE ROAD SAFETY IN THE UK
-- 1. Evaluate the median severity value of accidents caused by various Motorcycles?
SELECT label, 
       AVG(Accident_Severity) AS Median_Severity
FROM (
  SELECT VT.label, 
         A.Accident_Severity,
         @row_num := IF(@prev_label = VT.label, @row_num + 1, 1) AS row_num,
         @prev_label := VT.label
  FROM accidents_2015 A 
  JOIN Vehicles_2015 V ON A.Accident_Index = V.Accident_Index
  JOIN vehicle_types VT ON VT.Code = V.Vehicle_Type
  JOIN (SELECT @row_num := 0, @prev_label := '') AS vars
  WHERE VT.label LIKE '%Motorcycle%'
  ORDER BY VT.label, A.Accident_Severity
) AS Subquery
WHERE row_num = CEIL(@row_num / 2)
GROUP BY label;


-- 2. Evaluate Accident Severity and Total Accidents per Vehicle Type?
SELECT VT.label as Veichle_Type, A.Accident_Severity AS Accident_Severity, COUNT(1) AS Total_Accidents
FROM accidents_2015 A 
JOIN Vehicles_2015 V ON A.Accident_Index=V.Accident_Index
JOIN vehicle_types VT ON VT.Code=v.Vehicle_Type
GROUP BY VT.label,A.Accident_Severity
Order by Total_Accidents desc;

-- 3. Calculate the Average Severity by vehicle type.
SELECT VT.label as Vehicle_Type, AVG(A.Accident_Severity) AS Average_Severity FROM accidents_2015 A 
JOIN Vehicles_2015 V ON A.Accident_Index=V.Accident_Index
JOIN vehicle_types VT ON VT.Code=v.Vehicle_Type
GROUP BY VT.label;

-- 4. Calculate the Average Severity and Total Accidents by Motorcycle.
SELECT VT.label, AVG(A.Accident_Severity) AS Median_Severity, COUNT(1) AS Total_Accidents
FROM accidents_2015 A 
JOIN Vehicles_2015 V ON A.Accident_Index=V.Accident_Index
JOIN vehicle_types VT ON VT.Code=v.Vehicle_Type
WHERE VT.label LIKE '%Motorcycle%'
GROUP BY VT.label;
